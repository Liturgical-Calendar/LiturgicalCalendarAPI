### .env.example
### The following environment variables are useful for the Unit Test websocket server.
### In a local development environment, copy this file to .env.development to ensure that the Unit Test websocket server will run locally
###  and will use the local API instance to run tests.

### Set the same value for WS_PORT in the Unit Test frontend project folder.
### For more information, see https://github.com/Liturgical-Calendar/LiturgicalCalendarAPI/blob/development/LitCalTestServer.php
WS_PORT=8080

# Set the protocol to use for the API (default: "http")
API_PROTOCOL=http

# Set the hostname or IP address to use for the API (default: "localhost")
API_HOST=localhost

# Set the port number to use for the API (default: "8000")
# This will determine the port on which 'composer start' will launch the API.
# It will also instruct the Unit Test server on the port on which it should look for the API.
# If launching the API from VSCode tasks, make sure to set the same value in the tasks.json file.
API_PORT=8000

# Set the base path for the API (default: "/")
# This value is needed for the Unit Test server to connect to the API.
# It cannot know if the API path is `/`, `/api` or `/api/{version}`.
API_BASE_PATH=/

# When production, the API will add `/api/{version}` to the path
# where {version} is the version of the API that is automatically detected
# based on the current folder name (dev, v3, v4...).
# When development, no path will be added.
APP_ENV=development # development | production
