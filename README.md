# Liturgical Calendar
An API written in PHP that will generate the liturgical calendar for any given year, based on the General Roman Calendar, calculating the mobile festivities and the precedence of solemnities, feasts, memorials... Can also produce calendar data for nations, dioceses, or groups of dioceses. This calendar data can be served in various formats such as JSON, YAML, XML, or ICS. More information on the website https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/.

OpenAPI documentation [can be found here](https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/dist/) (kudos to @MichaelRShelton for generating the docs from the Swagger docker image).

The API is packaged as a composer library: run `composer install` to setup the autoload functionality.

Some characteristics of this API:
* **The data is based on official sources**, not copied from random internet sources. Sources used are the various editions of the **Roman Missal** in Latin, English, and Italian, **Magisterial documents**, and the **Decrees of the Congregation for Divine Worship**
    - Missale Romanum, Editio typica, 1970
    - Missale Romanum, Reimpressio emendata, 1971
    - Missale Romanum, Editio typica secunda, 1975
    - Missale Romanum, Editio typica tertia, 2002
    - Missale Romanum, Editio typica tertia emendata, 2008
    - [Mysterii Paschalis, PAULUS PP. VI, 1969](http://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/la/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19690214_mysterii-paschalis.html)
    - [Decrees of the Congregation of Divine Worship](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/index_it.htm)
* **The data is historically accurate**, *i.e.* the liturgical calendar produced for the year 1979 will reflect the calendar as it was in that year, and not as it would be today (obviously future years will reflect the calendar as it is generated in the current year; as new decrees are issued by the Congregation for Divine Worship or new editions of the Roman Missal are published, the script will need to be updated to account for any new criteria)


# Example applications
There are a few proof of concept example applications for usage of the API at https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/usage.php, which demonstrate generating an HTML representation of the Liturgical Calendar.

* The [first example](https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/examples/php/) uses cURL in PHP to make a request to the endpoint and handle the results.
* The [second example](https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/examples/javascript/) uses AJAX in Javascript to make the request to the endpoint and handle the results.
* The [third example](https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/examples/fullcalendar/examples/month-view.html) makes use of the [FullCalendar javascript framework](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar) to display the results from the AJAX request in a nicely formatted calendar view.
* The [fourth example](https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/examples/fullcalendar/examples/messages.html) is the same as the third except that it outputs the Messages first and the [FullCalendar](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar) calendar view after.

All of these examples request `JSON` as the data exchange format generated by the endpoint. Any application could use the endpoint in a similar manner: an Android App, a plugin for a Desktop Publishing App...

## Using the endpoint as a calendar URL for Calendar Apps

_(See [usage.php#calSubscription](https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/usage.php#calSubscription "https://litcal.johnromanodorazio.com/usage.php#calSubscription").)_

* **GOOGLE CALENDAR ON A DESKTOP COMPUTER**: you can only *add a calendar by URL* using Google Calendar on a computer, I don't believe it is possible from smartphone / Android devices. At the bottom left corner of the screen, next to **`Other calendars`**, click on the **`+`** to add a new calendar and choose **`From URL`**. Paste in the URL of the endpoint with the desired parameters, (make sure you use **`ICS`** as value of the *`return_type`* parameter). And remember, if you omit the *`year`* parameter, it will use the current year. This should mean that as Google Calendar continues to poll the calendar URL (supposedly every 8 hours), on the turn of a new year new events should be created automatically for the new year. Once the calendar has been added from a computer, it should become available for the same gmail account on the Google Calendar app on a smartphone.
* **CALENDAR APPS ON AN ANDROID DEVICE**: after you have *added a calendar by URL* in your Google Calendar on a Desktop Computer, you should then find that calendar synchronized with your Google account, so the calendar should become available to any Android Calendar apps that have access to your Google account to synchronize calendars.
* **IPHONE**: go to **`Phone Settings`** -> **`Accounts`** -> **`Add account`** -> **`Other`** -> **`Add Calendar`**, and paste in the endpoint URL with the desired parameters, (make sure you use **`ICS`** as value of the *`return_type`* parameter). And remember, if you omit the *`year`* parameter, it will use the current year. This should mean that as the iPhone Calendar continues to poll the calendar URL, on the turn of a new year new events should be created automatically for the new year.
* **MICROSOFT OUTLOOK** *(tested with Outlook 2013)*: at the bottom of the screen, switch from **`Email`** view to **`Calendar`** view. On the ribbon of the **`Home`** menu item, click on **`Open calendar`** -> **`From the internet`**. Paste the endpoint URL with the desired parameters, (make sure you use **`ICS`** as value of the *`return_type`* parameter). And remember, if you omit the *`year`* parameter, it will use the current year. On the following screen, check the checkbox along the lines of "Poll this calendar in the interval suggested by the creator", which would mean that Outlook Calendar should poll the calendar URL once a day. This means that without the *`year`* parameter, on the turn of a new year new events should be created automatically for the new year. Make sure the Calendar is created in the **`Other calendars`** folder; if you find it under the **`Personal calendars`** folder, drag it and drop it onto the **`Other calendars`** folder, this should ensure that it is treated as a subscription internet calendar. You can manually trigger an update against the calendar URL by clicking on **`Send/receive all`** (from the **`SEND/RECEIVE`** menu item). One highlight of the calendar in Outlook is that it supports a minimal amount of HTML in the event description, so the event descriptions in the Liturgical Calendar are a little bit more "beautified" for Outlook.

# Testing locally

To test the API locally, you can use PHP's builtin server. However, you will need to spawn at least a couple of workers, since some routes will make a request internally to another route. For example, a request to the `/calendar` route will make a request internally to the `/calendars` route.

Spawn at least two workers:
```bash
PHP_CLI_SERVER_WORKERS=2 php -S localhost:8000
```

For convenience when using VSCode, a `tasks.json` has been defined so that you can simply type <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> (<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> on MacOS) to start the PHP builtin server and open the browser.

 * update translations
## [v3.3](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v3.3) (January 27th 2022)
 * move festivity data from the 2008 Editio Typica Tertia emendata out from the `LitCalAPI.php`, to a JSON file
 * move data for festivities from Decrees of the Congregation of Divine Worship out from the `LitCalAPI.php`, to a JSON file
## [v3.2](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v3.2) (January 23rd 2022)
 * allow full CORS requests from enabled domains
 * allow Diocesan overrides for Epiphany, Ascension and Corpus Christi
## [v3.1](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v3.1) (December 26th 2021)
 * bugfix which was missed in the v3.0 release: 86ee62ad68d58736880da2b5b39117dec7386dfc

## [v3.0](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v3.0) (December 26th 2021)
 * all calendar data moved from a MySQL database to JSON files, that can be tracked in the repository
 * the Calendar data for the Universal Calendar, as contained in the JSON files, is now translatable to other languages through a Weblate project
 * the frontend and any implementations of the API have been moved to their own separate repositories,
   only the API code remains in this repository
 * the PHP source code for the API has been pretty much completely rewritten, using classes and enum type classes
 * all translatable strings in the PHP source code have been ported to `gettext`, and are now managed in a Weblate project
 * parameters `diocesanpreset` and `nationalpreset` have been renamed to `diocesancalendar` and `nationalcalendar`
 * API now supports POST requests that send JSON in the body instead of Form Data
 * Data type can be set through the `Accept` header rather than the `returntype` parameter
 * Language can be set through the `Accept-Language` header rather than the `locale` parameter

## [v2.9](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v2.9) (November 12th 2020)
 * adds Vigil Masses for Sundays and Solemnities, including occasional notes by the Congregation for Divine Worship
 * add Patron Saints of Europe, applicable for Italian Calendar (and eventually any other national calendar in Europe that may be added in the future)
 * add Saturday Memorial of the Blessed Virgin Mary

## [v2.8](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v2.8) (August 11th 2020)
 * adds `diocesanpreset` and `nationalpreset` parameters with relative calendar data
 * adds all of the data from the recent Decrees of the Congregation for Divine Worship and verifies integrity with past Decrees
 * ensures `Messages` returned are as specific as possible, while trying to keep the code as clean as possible
 * adds FullCalendar example

## [v2.7](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v2.7) (July 28th 2020)
 * adds `Messages` array to the data that is generated by the endpoint, justifying the calculations made for the generation of the requested calendar
 * fixes an issue with the memorial Saint Jane Frances de Chantal after 1999, when it was decided to move the memorial from Dec. 12 to Aug. 12 in order to allow Our Lady of Guadalupe on Dec. 12 (if another more important celebration took place on Dec. 12, Saint Jane Frances was being removed before it could be moved, this is now handled correctly)
add translations for the Messages array in Italian, English and Latin (please forgive my macaronic latin, it's not at all perfect, it's mostly conjecture, I hope to have it proofread at some point)
 * update PHP example to display `Messages` array in a table below the generated calendar
 * update PHP example to fix parsing of Liturgical colors for memorials with more than one possible Common and more than one possible liturgical color
 * fix a few errors in the database as regards liturgical colors for some memorials with more than one possible Common

## [v2.6](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v2.6) (July 26th 2020)
 * integrate the calculation of the liturgical cycle (YEAR A,B,C for festivities and YEAR I,II for weekdays) directly into the engine, so that applications that take care of elaborating the data for display don't have to worry about it
 * update both examples, PHP and Javascript, to use the new `liturgicalyear` property returned in the JSON data, and bring Javascript example up to par with the PHP example (add month cell that spans all events for that month)

## [v2.5](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v2.5) (July 25th 2020)
 * make sure all endpoint parameters can have values with either uppercase or lowercase characters
 * fix a few small issues with the ICS data generation

## [v2.4](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/v2.4) (July 24th 2020)
 * move as many festivities as possible to the MySQL tables to allow for localization (mobile feasts will be calculated in the script, but still need to be localized)
 * add ICS data generation (requires more localization strings, because it is already a form of final display of the data)

## [v2.0](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/2.0) (January 8th 2018)
 * separate the display logic from the engine, so that the engine can act as an endpoint
 * make the engine return JSON or XML data that the display logic can use to generate a user-friendly representation of the data

## [v1.0](https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/LiturgicalCalendar/releases/tag/1.0) (July 26th 2017)
 * proof of concept for the correct generation of a liturgical calendar
 * create MySQL table for the Proper of the Saints
